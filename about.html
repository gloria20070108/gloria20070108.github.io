        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student in the master of Computer Science program at
          Northeastern University and passionate to become a software engineer.
          My completed courses include Algorithms, Computer Systems, Discrete
          and Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design.<br />
          I am also a registered nurse and certified diabetes educator with
          experience of health education, program evaluation and development.<br />
          I believe that hobbies, such as dancing, painting and playing piano,
          help destress myself while remaining mentally productive.<br />
          Besides being a student, I am a mother with a three-year old. No
          matter how busy I am, I always find time for my family.
